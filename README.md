# Hi there, I’m Jono 👋

I've been programming for about a year, starting with humble beginnings in a custom scripting language AutoHotkey for fast macro-creation and software automation. Shortly thereafter, I learned the basics of JavaScript and decided fast-track my journey by taking a course.

I recently graduated from a Full stack flex coding bootcamp program from the University of Sydney. I'm currently open to developer roles - check out my [portfolio](https://jcarait.dev/)
